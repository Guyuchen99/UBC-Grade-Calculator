# UBC Grade Calculator

## About the Project 
Have you ever been worried about whether you'll actually pass a specific course toward the end of the semester? 
If this sounds like you, then you've come to the right place. This application is specially designed to help you and 
all other students at UBC who want to have an easier time calculating their final grade for each of their class and 
predict what percentage they must score on the final exam to pass. Furthermore, it provides you with an opportunity 
to set a realistic target and this application will help you determine what you need to get on your final exam to 
obtain that awesome grade that you desire.

The reason I chose to make this project is because I am the type of person who always wants to know and set goals 
for myself about what I need to score on that final exam in order to receive a good grade. I am also very passionate 
about creating something that everyone can use and benefit from. 
Thus, I hope that the visual illustration of this project will motivate you to study harder so that you will also 
receive the grade that you desire.
